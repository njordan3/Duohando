    <p class="text-lg">
        This lesson will introduce simple numbers and give you a guideline
        to master the basic formations. You will learn to form signed numbers
        with ease and quickly be counting up to a million on one hand. Along
        the way, you’ll also learn how to sign fractions.

    <h1 class="header">Situations that Call for Numbers</h1>
    <p class="text-lg">
        You use many different kinds of numbers in your daily conversation. For
        instance, a conversation might include a phone number, credit card number, and
        so forth. Now it’s time for you to learn how to use numbers in ASL.
        Unfortunately, a novice signer often feels that numbers are confusing and
        somewhat complicated. In order to minimize confusion, this lesson will take a
        look at examples of numbers that seem to be the pitfalls for new signers. These
        particular numbers are the ones that share the same handshapes as the letters of
        the alphabet, thus causing the confusion. The context of a conversation generally
        adds the clarity that is needed to distinguish between a signed number and letter.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
            The way numbers are signed can vary according to region. In some regions, the
        numbers are signed with the palms facing you; in others, the palm is facing the
        reader. Both palm positions are correct, depending on your geographical region
        and perhaps on your ASL teacher as well.

    <h1 class="header">Counting to Ten</h1>
    <p class="text-md">
        Counting to ten is easy. You have been doing this since you were a child. In this
        case, however, there is one difference. When you were a child, you had to use
        two hands to count this high. In sign language, you can count to ten (and much
        higher) using just one hand!
    </p>
    <button class="info-button btn btn-outline-dark" type="button" value="Number" class="btn btn-outline-dark">Number</button>

    <p class="text-md">
        Notice that the counting process changes for six through nine.
        It’s easy; you only need to touch a specific finger to your thumb.
        In sign language, the pinky finger represents the number “6”.
        The ring finger represents the number “7.” The middle finger represents the
        number “8.” The index finger represents the number “9.” When you lightly
        touch any of these four fingers separately to the thumb, this action confirms the
        number position.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md">
        Now, let’s examine those numbers and letters that share the same handshapes
        and that are the cause of some confusion for novice signers:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-md">
        <li>The number “2” is formed in the same way as the letter “V”</li>
        <li>The number “6” is formed in the same way as the letter “W”</li>
        <li>The number “9” is formed in the same way as the letter “F”</li>
        <li>The number “10” is formed in the same way as the letter “A”, but with the addition of a twist of the wrist</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="header">Number Hand Shapes as Descriptors</h1>
    <p class="text-lg">
        You will find that the handshapes of numbers are also used as descriptors.
        Instructions in sign language dictionaries often refer to numbers to describe
        handshapes. For example, you may see entries that tell you to use the “one” hand
        or to use the “three” hand. Knowing how to form all the handshapes, including numbers, is a
        very important part of your new journey into this visual language.

    <h1 class="header">Counting from 11 to 20</h1>
    <p class="text-lg">
        Now it’s time to move on and learn the next section of numbers. As a memory
        guide to help you along, the numbers “11” through “15” will be referred to as the
        “flicks” (You’ll see why in just a moment). Look back at the images of “1”
        through “5” and set them in your mind. The reason; numbers “11” to “15” use
        the same handshapes as numbers “1” through “5”.
    </p>
    <button class="info-button btn btn-outline-dark" type="button" value="11">11</button>

    <button class="info-button btn btn-outline-dark" type="button" value="15">15</button>
    <p class="text-lg">
        Moving right along, let’s take on numbers “16” through “19,” which are
        referred to as the “swing-outs”. The good news is that the finger positions for
        numbers that contain a “6” through “9” remain constant. These numbers begin
        with the palm facing you and then swing out to the right ending with the palm
        facing forward. Forming the number “16” begins by touching the thumb to the
        pinky, palm facing you, then swinging out to face the receiver. The numbers
        “17” through “19” are formed in the same manner, by first touching your thumb
        to the appropriate fingers then swinging out. The sign for “20” is a stand-alone sign.

    <h1 class="header">Counting to 90</h1>
    <p class="text-lg">
        In order to form the handshapes for
        the numbers “30”, “40”, “50”, “60”, “70”, “80”, and “90” you will need to sign
        the basic number first, such as “3”, “4”, or “5”. You will then sign a “0” (zero).
        A memory aid for these numbers is an easy formula: The number then changes to zero.

    <h1 class="header">Big Numbers</h1>
    <p class="text-md">
        You have made it all the way up to “99.” Now you will begin working on large
        numbers. The big numbers—hundreds, thousands, millions—require the simple
        application of modified Roman numerals. These signs are compound signs.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md">
        The letter “C” represents the Roman numeral for “hundred.” When you want to sign
        a number in the hundreds, you form the number, then add the letter “C”. For
        example, if you sign “1” then the letter “C” this equals “100”. You can continue
        in the same pattern for “200”, “300”, “400”, and so on. A good memory aid: A
        hundred-dollar bill is often referred to as a “C note”.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md">
        The letter “M” represents the Roman numeral for “thousand.” When you want
        to sign a number in the thousands you form the number, and add the letter “M”.
        It is the same pattern that you use for forming numbers in the hundreds. A
        “million” is signed by tapping the letter “M” twice in the palm.
    </p>
    <button class="info-button btn btn-outline-dark" type="button" value="Hundred">Hundred</button>
    <button class="info-button btn btn-outline-dark" type="button" value="Thousand">Thousand</button>
    <p class="text-md">
        Here is an example of the two different ways you could sign the number “1,900”:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-md">
        <li>When referring to “1900” as “nineteen hundred,” sign “19,” followed by the letter “C,” representing the Roman numeral for 100.</li>
        <li>When signing “1900” to represent “one thousand nine hundred,” sign “1,” followed by “M,” representing the Roman numeral for 1,000, then “9,” followed by “C.” Memory aid: Numbers are signed the way you say them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="header">Fractions</h1>
    <p class="text-lg">
        Fractions are signed exactly the way they appear, one number over the other.
        First sign the top number, the numerator, followed by the bottom number, the
        denominator. In this example, the visual of a “1” above a “2” demonstrates a
        numeric fraction. Use this same pattern and order of signs for all fractions.

    <h1 class="header">Conversations with Letters and Numbers</h1>
    <p class="text-lg">
        When a conversation occurs that requires both letters and numbers, such as a
        password or an e-mail address, the dilemma can be resolved in two easy ways.
        The first solution is to slightly shake the numbers back and forth while
        maintaining a smooth flow for the letters. This slight movement helps to
        establish that you are signing a number and not a letter. The second solution is to
        sign all numbers with the palm facing you and all letters with the palm facing the
        reader. Of these two methods, the first one, shaking the numbers, is the easiest
        for the novice signer.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
        Numbers fill your daily life. To help manage all those numbers, an easy rule to
        follow is to sign numbers exactly the way they are spoken. When you want to
        tell someone your phone number, you will sign numbers in groups as they are
        written. Phone numbers are grouped with the area code first, followed by three
        numbers, then by four numbers. To sign your phone number, simply hesitate just
        a bit in between each group of numbers: “555” (hesitate), “555” (hesitate),
        “5555.” Don’t drop your hands; just hesitate.
