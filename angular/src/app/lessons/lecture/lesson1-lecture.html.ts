    <p class="text-lg">
        Fingerspelling is the letter representation of each of the twenty-six
        letters of the alphabet. The use of fingerspelling is limited in ASL. It is
        primarily used to communicate places and names when no formal
        recognized signs exist. Fingerspelling has very specific rules and only
        represents about 10 percent of the language’s overall elements.
        However, mastering the manual alphabet is an important complement
        to ASL. This skill will assist you in understanding the handshapes of
        the signs you will learn throughout Handango. In this lesson, you will
        find fingerspelling exercises to help you master the manual alphabet.

    <h1 class="header">Situations that Call for Fingerspelling</h1>
    <p class="text-lg">
        When you don’t know a sign for a word, try to describe it by acting it out,
        pointing, miming, or drawing it. Don’t use fingerspelling as your first choice
        when you don’t know a sign. Fingerspelling is not a substitute for signing; it is
        used for words when a sign does not exist. In ASL, fingerspelling is only used
        approximately 10 percent of the time and should only be used for:

    <h1 class="header">Tips for Becoming an Accurate Fingerspeller</h1>
    <ul class="text-lg">
        <li>Make sure your palm faces the receiver/reader</li>
        <li>Hold your dominant hand slightly to the right of your face and just below the chin</li>
        <li>Make sure your elbow is close to your body</li>
        <li>Do not bounce the letters</li>
        <li>Relax, and let the letters flow smoothly</li>
        <li>Speed is not important; it is the clarity of the formation of each letter that matters</li>
        <li>Do not say or mouth single letters</li>
        <li>Move slightly to the right or slide slightly to the right for double letters</li>
        <li>Practice fingerspelling with your elbow resting on a table or desk</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-lg">Otherwise you might suffer from what the deaf community calls "Bobber-Weaver Syndrome" and "Wing Thing"</p>
</div>

<div class="mySlides">
    <h1 class="header">Bobber-Weaver and Wing Thing</h1>
    <p class="text-md">
            Bobber-weaver syndrome is when the signer fingerspells and
        moves her wrist and hand position, like a car weaving out of control. This
        pattern and flow is erratic, making it difficult to comprehend what is being
        fingerspelled.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md">
            The “wing-thing” is when the signer, while fingerspelling,
        constantly lifts her elbow away from the body, as if about to take flight.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md">
            To help control and prevent these errors, here are a few tricks that you can
        learn. During an ASL conversation in which you fingerspell, use your left arm as
        a support for your right elbow. (If your left hand is dominant, then use your right
        for support). Another way to stabilize your hand and arm is to
        hold your wrist with your left hand, just below the wrist bone. This enables you
        to immediately feel when your fingerspelling becomes out of control or is
        starting to take flight. For the novice signer, another less obvious stabilizer is to
        place the left index finger on the front of the right wrist.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md">
            While practicing fingerspelling, try applying these small safeguards for a nice
        steady and smooth flow. Believe it or not, before you even realize it, you will not
        need to apply these fingerspelling safeguards at all. In the beginning, though,
        these serve as control mechanisms that help the novice signer quite nicely.

    <h1 class="header">Hand Warm-ups for Practice</h1>
    <p class="text-lg">
        When you fingerspell, you will be using your hands in a manner that you’re not
        accustomed to. Therefore, to prevent any discomfort, it’s a good idea to do some
        hand exercises and warm-ups, for example:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-lg">
        <li>Shake your hands briskly with your fingers parted</li>
        <li>Stretch your hand to an open-finger “five” position until you can feel the skin stretching between each finger</li>
        <li>Create a piano strum, starting with your pinky, and ending with your index finger</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="header">Additional Uses for Fingerspelling</h1>
    <p class="text-lg">
        Initialized signs, also known as borrowed signs, are signs that, in general,
        borrow the first letter of words. These signed words require placing and/or moving
        a letter of the manual alphabet in specific locations on or around the body.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
        Another way the letters of the manual alphabet are used is in the application of
        fingerspelled “loan signs” and fingerspelled abbreviations. “Loan signs” have
        unique patterns and movements. They normally have two to five letters, and they
        are commonly used words. It should be noted that "loan signs" also have regular whole
        ASL signs, so you can think of "loan signs" like saying "y'all" instead of "you all".
        These words are all formed and shaped in various patterns, like so:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-lg">
        <li>“Bus” is fingerspelled using “B” to “S” in a vertical, downward movement</li>
        <li>“All” is fingerspelled using “A” to “L” in a sweeping movement from left to right</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="mySlides">
    <h1 class="header">Abbreviations</h1>
    <p class="text-lg">
        Everyday words can quickly be abbreviated applying the manual alphabet.
        Often, it is manually abbreviated words like these that become the recognized
        loan signs in time:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-lg">
        <li>“Air-conditioning” is fingerspelled using “A”, and “C” in place</li>
        <li>“Barbecue” is fingerspelled using “B”, “B”, and “Q” in place</li>
        <li>“High School” is fingerspelled using “H”, and “S” in place</li>
        <li>“Identification” is fingerspelled using “I”, and “D” in place</li>
        <li>“Avenue” is fingerspelled using “A”, “V”, and “E” in place</li>
        <li>“Boulevard” is fingerspelled using “B”, “L”, “V”, and “D” in place</li>
        <li>“Overtime” is fingerspelled using “O” and “T” in place</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-lg">
        Lastly, here is a cute abbreviation: Form the letter “P.” Now trace the letter
        “Z” in front of you. You’ve just ordered a “pizza”! This is just one of the many
        different and fun ways you can sign “pizza”.
