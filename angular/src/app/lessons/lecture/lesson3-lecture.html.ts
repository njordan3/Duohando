    <h1 class="header">Questions</h1>
    <p class="text-lg">
        Our daily conversations are filled with questions. Therefore, in order
        to communicate effectively using ASL, you’ll need to learn how to ask
        and receive questions. This lesson will teach you to form questions
        and apply them with appropriate facial expressions.
    </p>

<div class="mySlides">
    <h1 class="header">Two Types of Questions</h1>
    <p class="text-lg">
        The first type of questions are “wh-” words: who, what, when,
        where, why, which, and how. Questions that use these words ask for specific
        information. The second category is “yes-no” questions. These questions can be
        answered with a simple yes or no.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
        Both of these question types need to be supported by specific facial
        expressions with nonmanual behaviors. Nonmanual behaviors do not use the
        hands. Instead, these behaviors use the eyes, facial expressions, head movement,
        body posture, or body language. Signers use nonmanual behaviors to show
        emotion, emphasize a point, make a negative statement, and ask questions.
        Facial expressions are equal to vocal intonation. When you do not apply the
        proper facial expressions and nonmanual behaviors, your questions may not be
        interpreted correctly.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="mySlides">
    <h1 class="header">Wh- Words</h1>
    <p class="text-lg">
        When asking a wh-word question, do the following:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-lg">
        <li>Furrow your eyebrows together</li>
        <li>Tilt your head forward</li>
        <li>Make direct eye contact</li>
        <li>Hold your last sign</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-lg">
        Take a minute now and sign the alphabet in order to refresh these handshapes in
        your mind. Throughout this book, the directions on how to form signs will refer
        to handshapes, such as the “D” hand or “F” hand. These instructions are simply
        describing a handshape and generally, there is minimal association with the letter
        value.

    <p class="text-lg">
        When asking a yes-no question, do the following:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-lg">
        <li>Raise your eyebrows to widen your eyes</li>
        <li>Tilt your head slightly forward</li>
        <li>Make direct eye contact</li>
        <li>Hold the last sign in your sentence</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-lg">
        Occasionally, a yes-no question is accompanied by a question mark.

    <h1 class="header">Interview Questions Part 1</h1>
    <p class="text-sm">
        During your sign language journey, chances are good that you will meet a
        member of the Deaf community. You will need to be prepared to answer a few
        questions. It is natural and considered a part of the culture for a member of the
        Deaf community to ask you several questions. The reason for these many
        questions is to establish a connection back to the Deaf community.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm">
        Looking at the following chart of interview questions, you will notice that the
        questions are written in English order and then the questions are written in
        approximate ASL sign order. The answers are presented in a simple ASL sign
        order. At first, this sign order will sound strange to your auditory ear. You must
        keep in mind that sign language is a visual language. Therefore, how it sounds
        grammatically is not relative to the way it is received through the eyes. The sign
        order, as written, is perfectly acceptable. Remember:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-sm">
        <li>When signing the wh- words, your eyebrows are down and furrowed</li>
        <li>When answering yes, use a nod</li>
        <li>When answering no, shake your head</li>
    </ul>

        Adapting to ASL sign order, facial expressions, and nonmanual behaviors are
        skills that develop slowly with practice and experience. At this point, your
        primary focus is learning to form the signs accurately, while gradually learning
        how to apply these additional elements. In order to do this, you will need to
        practice signing these questions and responses the way they have been written in
        the chart.

    <h1 class="header">Rhetorical Questions</h1>
    <p class="text-lg">
        The facial expressions and nonmanual behaviors used when asking a rhetorical
        question include raising the eyebrows and tilting the head to the side and back.
        However, rhetorical questions are not true questions, and a response is not
        expected. It is the signer’s intention, immediately following this type of
        question, to supply the answers and information. Rhetorical questions are
        commonly used in ASL and in the Deaf community. Using this type of question
        allows a signer to quickly get the attention of others and to introduce a new
        subject or information.
